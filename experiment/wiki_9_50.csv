MHS	35963263	2006-01-20T15:35:25Z	MHS adalah singkatan kepada Malacca High School atau Sekolah Tinggi Melaka. Sekolah ini dibina pada tahun 1826 oleh kerajaan Inggeris dan ia merupakan sekolah kedua tertua di Malaysia selepas Penang Free School.  '''Sejarah Sekolah''' 7 Disember 1826, MHS dengan rasminta telah ditubuhkan. Penubuhan ini tidak lama setelah kejayaan Melayu Melaka menjadi tanah jajahan Inggeris pada 12 Mac 1824. penubuhan sekolah ini telah diilhamkan oleh Thomas H. Moor yang telah datang ke Malaka pada 1825 atas undangan Milne untuk menjadi salah seorang tenaga pengajar di Anglo Chinese College.Dalam suratnya yang bertarikh 4 Januari 1825, beliau menyatakan hasrat kepada Arundel di London untuk membuka sebuah sekolah. Ilham beliau dipersetujui oleh beberapa orang kenalan yang berpengaruh termasuklah James Humphrey ( seorang SUPERINTENDENT dlm London Society's mission ).   Sekolah ini dibina setelah sebuah sekolah Melayu-Belanda ( Netherland ) yang dibina  oleh mubaligh Kristian pada Januari 1819. Sekolah ini ditutup kerana pertukaran penjajah ( Belanda ke Inggeris ).  MHS bermula dengan nama Malacca Free School. Ia berbeza dengan konsep Penang Free School & Singapore Free School. Hal ini kerana PFS dan SFC hanya 'free' pada nama dan pengambilan pelajarnya. 'Free'dalam Malacca Free School bermakna percuma tanpa dikenakan bayaran.
