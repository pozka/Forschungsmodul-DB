Goldschmidt Sex Scandal	12760204	2005-04-24T18:51:03Z	'''''The Goldschimdt Sex Scandal''''' was the fallout from revelations that former [[Portland]] Mayor and [[Oregon]] [[Governor]] [[Neil Goldschmidt]] had been involved in a seuxal relationship with a 14-year-old girl in the [[1970's]]. The affair, the twenty-five year coverup that followed, and the manner in which the story was finally broken to the public led to numerous questions over the relationship between public figures and the [[media]]. The scandal is also believed to have played a role in the failure of [[Texas Pacific Group]], a company that had hired Goldschmist as a cosnultant, to win regulatory approval for its purchase of [[Portland General Electric]].  == Abuse and Cover-Up ==  In the 1970's, Neil Goldschmidt was the young and charistmatic Mayor of Portland. At that time, he also began an affair with a 14-year-old girl who had been hired by him as a babysitter. Although Goldschmidt would later claim all the contact was consensual, they consitutted statutory rape under Oregon law.  As Goldschmidt's career advanced, he was compelled to make sure that his conduct did not become public. This included paying a substantial settlement to the victim. Goldschmidt was also later accused of granting political favors to friends who had helped him dcover up the affair. The starin of maintaining the coverup was cited later as a probable reason that Godlschmidt had chosen not to seek re-election as Oregon Governor.  The [[statute of limitations]] on the crime expired in the 1990s, freeing Goldschmidt from the threat of criminal prosecution.  == Revelations ==  Throughout Goldschmidt's career, jounralists were suspicious that Goldschmidt had been trying to cover something up. However, few media outlets were willing to allow their reporters to investigate the matter further. In 2003, while Goldschmidt was employed by Texas Pacific Group, reporter [[Nigel Jaquiss]] of the [[alternative weekly]] [[Willamette Week]] began an investigation that uncovered most of the details of the scandal and the coverup.  Goldschmidt found out the story was going to be publisehd a week in advance. He sent a confession letter to [[the Oregonian]], which the newspaper published verbaitm on the front page. It contradicted many elements of the [[Willamette Week]] story and attempted to portray Goldschmidt in a more favorable light.  The [[Willamette Week]] story came out on schedule the next Wednesday. It detailed not just the sexual abuse but also the extensive coer-up. Jaquiss would win the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in [[2005]] for his reporting on the story.  == The Fallout ==  Neil Goldschmidt's public career was effectively destroyed by the scandal. He left Texas Pacific Group, closed down his consulting business, and resigned from the [[oregon State Bar]]. A [[Republican]] legislator demanded that his portrait be revoced from the [[Oregon State Capitol]]. Meanwhile, his supporters accused [[Willamette Week]] and other media outlets of engaging in [[character assassination]].  [[The Oregonian]] was roundly condemned for its handling of the affair. Not only was the newspaper accused of giving an admitted [[sex offender]] a forum in which to present his unchallenged view of the affair, but questions were raised as to why the Oreognian did not pursue the story earlier, while Goldschmidt was still a powerful poltiical figure.   [[Multnomah County]] Sheriff [[Bernie Giusto]], who had been an officer of the [[Oregon State Police]] during Goldschmidt's tenure as Governor and had been a driver for his family, was questioned by the media over what he knew at the time, as was current Oregon Governor [[Ted Kulongoski]].  Due to the [[statute of limitations]], no criminal charges were filed against Goldschmidt. No civil action been filed against him. The victim herself has never come forward.
